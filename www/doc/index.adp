  <p>@package_name@ implements all the IT needs for a standard
    business-to-consumer web service.  Most importantly, it is tightly
    integrated with the rest of the Open Architecture Community System
    (OpenACS).  This enables the site administrator to run a single
    query to "find users who have participated in the discussion forum
    on at least ten separate occasions but who have not bought
    anything yet", then spam those folks with gift certificates.</p>

  <p>In addition to the standard shopping cart and real-time credit
    card billing that you'd expect in any ecommerce system, @package_name@
    provides a customer service submodule (call center support),
    security, user tracking, gift certificates, mailing lists, an
    auditing system, order fulfillment, order tracking, special offers,
    and online reporting, among other features detailed in the overview
    below.</p>
